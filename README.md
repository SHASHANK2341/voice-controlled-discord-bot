# About

It is a voice controlled Discord Bot, means you (mainly) do not use prefix / Slash Commands, no! You will be using your VOICE.

Ofc. you somehow need to parse that audio, for that I am using https://wit.ai which is a free speech-to-text ai, which you need to train!
That means it might sometimes not return what you say... but I tested it over 19 months on another Project, and there it works 100% everytime, even multilangual now..

It is a Music Bot, as other interactions are not that optimal, like kick / ban, you can't control that with voice 100% sure...

# How to use the Bot? | [Check the Video](https://github.com/SHASHANK2341/voice-controlled-discord-bot/blob/main/README.md#explanation-and-show-off-video)
 0. *[Join the testing Server](https://discord.gg/TWRJH6ACvR) - Prefix: `v!`* / [self-host it!](https://github.com/SHASHANK2341/voice-controlled-discord-bot/blob/main/README.md#self-hosting)
 1. Join a Discord Voice-Channel, *in a Server, where the Bot is in!*
 2. Type in a Text-Channel `v!control` or `@Bot control`
	 a. *Now it'll only listen and be controlable by YOU* 
 3. Speak your COMMANDS and add a KEYWORD in beforehand.

 4. Tipps to get understood more often!

	 b. Also Make sure to Reduce background noices, speak clear and fluently to be "recogniced" by the bot pretty well!
